## Problem Section
âœ… Implemented
- Heading: "Turn Expertise into Action, Without Technical Bottlenecks"
- Subheading: "Does your organization struggle to translate deep domain knowledge into the custom tools and automated workflows needed to stay competitive? Relying on overburdened IT departments or costly external developers creates delays, stifles innovation, and leaves your subject-matter experts unable to fully leverage their insights. You need a way for your experts to directly drive the creation of solutions they need."

Problem Cards:
1. Skills Gap & Resource Strain
   - "Your IT team is stretched thin, and specialized AI talent is scarce. With AI developers commanding $150K+ salaries and 6-month hiring cycles, the cost of delay compounds while your innovation backlog grows."

2. Slow Development Cycles
   - "Watch weeks turn into months as your innovative ideas get stuck in development queues, losing competitive advantage with each passing day. Every delay means missed opportunities and market share."

3. Underutilized Expertise
   - "Your experts know exactly what solutions they need, but are forced to wait on technical teams â€“ turning their innovative ideas into frustrating bottlenecks. Stop letting valuable insights get lost in translation."
